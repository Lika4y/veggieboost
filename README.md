# Veggieboost

**Description**

This educational project is a landing page for purchasing vegetables. The site is responsive and will display well on various devices.  

When you click on the Order button, you can select products and place an order.  

After submitting the form, the data goes to Google Sheets(Sheet2). Also, after the user places a callback order and sends their phone number, their number goes to Google Sheets(Sheet1).
